A lightweight interactive map application that displays detailed location information based on where the user clicks. Built with plain HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Leaflet, and OpenStreetMap’s Nominatim API.

## Overview

GeoTap is a simple and responsive web application that allows users to click anywhere on the map and instantly retrieve location details.  
The app uses reverse geocoding to fetch address information and displays it in a popup at the clicked location.  
The interface is minimal, fast, and works well on all screen sizes.
